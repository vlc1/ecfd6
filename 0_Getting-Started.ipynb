    "- From binaries available in the [Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/) section of the language' [official website](https://julialang.org/) du language;\n",
    "- Using [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), a **Julia installer and version multiplexer** that allows multiple versions of Julia to be installed simultaneously and easy switching between.\n",

    "<b>Info</b>: the first stable release of Julia (v1.0) <a href=\"https://julialang.org/blog/2018/08/one-point-zero/\">was announced in August 2018</a>. All subsequent versions (v1.9 will soon be released) are backward compatible, and the core developpers (most of whom are part of <a href=\"https://juliahub.com/\">JuliaHub</a>, previously Julia Computing) have <strong>no intention whatsoever to launch a v2.0</strong>.\n",

    "On **Windows**, simply search \"Julia\" in Microsoft store and install the application (it's actually juliaup which is installed). Equivalently, execute the following command:\n",
